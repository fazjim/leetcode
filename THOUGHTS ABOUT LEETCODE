THOUGHTS ABOUT LEETCODE

1.  If too much time complexity from one side, try binary split or merge from sides. (container with water)
2.  Corner cases:
  a) Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE   judge if over   x >  (Integer.MAX_VALUE- y) / z
3.  Sometimes for easy cases, code lookup will be faster than writing the logic judgements (integer to roman)
4.  Ideas of KMP:  build a prefix and postfix table and use the match to increase the strides for moving
5.  ListNode, find a position, using fast and slow pointers
6.  Use of heap/PriorityQueue for n-best problems
7.  Be careful of the overflow cases, for example (a+b)/2, but a+b may overflow
